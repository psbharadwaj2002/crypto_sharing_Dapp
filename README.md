# Crypto_Sharing_DApp
Crypto Sharing DApp is a site where users may exchange cryptocurrency with one another. This would be a distinctive and safe method of sharing coins as the globe moves toward cryptocurrency. The project is being launched in Web 3.0 because it is secure. Blockchain technology's capacity to decentralizeÂ all transactions without the need for a middleman is one of its key benefits. In order for users to have a positive transaction experience, a user interface is designed. To begin the transaction, the user must provide the recipient's wallet address and the desired amount. The user needs to approve the transaction after clicking the send now button. The user will get a notification detailing the transaction cost, which includes petrol fees, after confirming the purchase. Once the user confirms the message, the transaction is completed. The blockchain is used to distribute the block containing the transactional data. After a successful transaction, a block is put onto the ledger. Each party to the transaction has a copy, including the user and the recipient.
